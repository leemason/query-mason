# SQL Mason

[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/leemason/sql-mason.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/leemason/sql-mason)

A Node JS SQL Query Builder.

Inspired by Laravel and Knex this is a decoupled SQL builder ONLY!

No db connection, no config, just a builder. It currently supports MySQL dialects with plans for other MySQL engines in the future.
